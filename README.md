Hey There!

I'm a developer, engineering leader and entrepreneur living in Berlin.

I'm a proactive member in the tech community, through contributions to open source software, coaching, speaking and organising events.

In the last years I organized more than 20 events, ranging from meetups to +1000 people conferences, like EuroPython and PyCon DE & PyData Berlin.

I'm a Python Software Foundation Fellow and former board member of the EuroPython Society.
